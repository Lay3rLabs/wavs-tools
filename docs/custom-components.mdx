Use the info in this guide to customize the template to create your own custom service. Check out the [WAVS design considerations](/design) page to learn which use-cases WAVS is best suited for.

## Trigger

The simple onchain trigger contract in the template is used to emit triggers to the WAVS service. The trigger data is encoded as a bytes object. When a WAVS component receives this trigger, it uses the `decode_event_log_data!` macro from the [`wavs-wasi-chain`](https://docs.rs/wavs-wasi-chain/latest/wavs_wasi_utils/all.html#functions) crate to decode the event data for processing.

In the template, each trigger has a unique ID that links it to its data. The component processes the trigger data and returns results. Results are submitted back to the blockchain via the submission contract.

The [trigger contract in the WAVS foundry template](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/blob/v0.3.0/src/contracts/WavsTrigger.sol) is a simple example that takes generic bytes and passes them to the component. When developing a custom trigger, you will need to update the template code in a few places:

1. The trigger contract itself in [`src/WavsTrigger.sol`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/src/contracts/WavsTrigger.sol), which defines how triggers are created and emitted on-chain.
2. The trigger script in [`/script/Trigger.s.sol`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/script/Trigger.s.sol#L15), which calls the `addTrigger` function with the `coinMarketCapID`.
3. The `decode_trigger_event` function in [`/components/evm-price-oracle/src/trigger.rs`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/components/evm-price-oracle/src/trigger.rs#L11-L21), which processes the trigger data and extracts the `trigger_id` and `data`.
4. The `run` function in [`/components/evm-price-oracle/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/components/evm-price-oracle/src/lib.rs#L13), which calls `decode_trigger_event`, processes the extracted trigger data, and determines how to handle it.
5. The `wasi-exec` command in the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/Makefile#L39-L43), which passes input data when testing WAVS components via `--input cast format-bytes32-string $(COIN_MARKET_CAP_ID)`. This simulates an Ethereum event during local execution.

## Component

WASI components contain the main logic of a WAVS service. They are responsible for processing the trigger data and executing the business logic of a service.

A basic component has three main parts:

1. Decoding incoming trigger data.
2. Processing the data (this is the custom logic of your component).
3. Encoding and returning the result for submission.

```rust lib.rs
pub mod bindings;
use crate::bindings::{export, Guest, TriggerAction};
struct Component;
export!(Component with_types_in bindings);

impl Guest for Component {
    fn run(action: TriggerAction) -> std::result::Result<Option<Vec<u8>>, String> {
        // 1. Decode the trigger data
        let (trigger_id, req, dest) = decode_trigger_event(action.data)?;

        // 2. Process the data (Your custom logic here)
        let result = process_data(req)?;

        // 3. Encode and return the result
        let output = match dest {
            Destination::Ethereum => Some(encode_trigger_output(trigger_id, &result)),
            Destination::CliOutput => Some(result),
        };
        Ok(output)
    }
}
```

Components must implement the `Guest` trait, which is the main interface between your component and the WAVS runtime. The `run` function is the entry point for processing triggers: it receives the trigger data, decodes it, processes it according to your component's logic, and returns the results. Results can be sent back to Ethereum (when triggered by a contract event) or returned as CLI output (when triggered manually during testing). Error handling is done through the `Result` type. In the foundry template, bindings are automatically generated for any files in the `/components` and `/src` directories when the `make build` command is run.

### Building Components

Dependencies for components are added to the `Cargo.toml` file in the `components` directory.

```toml
[dependencies]
# Essential dependencies
wit-bindgen-rt = {workspace = true}    # Required for WASI bindings and Guest trait
wavs-wasi-chain = { workspace = true }  # Required for core WAVS functionality
# Optional dependencies
serde = { workspace = true }            # For serialization (if working with JSON)
serde_json = { workspace = true }       # For JSON handling
alloy-sol-macro = { workspace = true }  # For Ethereum contract interactions
wstd = { workspace = true }             # For WASI standard library features
alloy-sol-types = { workspace = true }  # For Ethereum ABI handling
anyhow = { workspace = true }           # For enhanced error handling
```

#### Testing

Components can be built for local testing using the following commands. The `wasi-exec` command allows you to simulate triggers, and you can view the component's logs in stdout/stderr to debug its execution.

```bash
# Build the component
make build

# Test locally
make wasi-exec
```

### `wavs-wasi-chain` crate

The `wavs-wasi-chain` crate provides a set of helpful functions for making HTTP requests and interacting with the blockchain. It also provides a macro for decoding trigger data for use in the component.

Learn more in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/wavs-wasi-chain/latest/wavs_wasi_utils/all.html#functions).

### Network requests

Components can make network requests to external APIs using the `wavs-wasi-chain` crate.

The following dependencies are useful for making HTTP requests from a component. These are added to a component's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
wavs-wasi-chain = { workspace = true }  # HTTP utilities
wstd = { workspace = true }             # Runtime utilities
serde = { workspace = true }            # Serialization
serde_json = { workspace = true }       # JSON handling
```

The following example shows how to make a basic HTTP GET request from a component:

```rust lib.rs
async fn make_request() -> Result<YourResponseType, String> {
    // Create the request
    let url = "https://api.example.com/endpoint";
    let mut req = http_request_get(&url).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    // Add headers
    req.headers_mut().insert(
        "Accept",
        HeaderValue::from_static("application/json")
    );

    // Make the request and parse JSON response
    let json: YourResponseType = fetch_json(req)
        .await
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    Ok(json)
}
```

For making POST requests with JSON data, you can use the [`http_request_post_json` helper function](https://docs.rs/wavs-wasi-chain/latest/wavs_wasi_utils/http/fn.http_request_post_json.html), which automatically handles JSON serialization and sets header to `application/json`:

```rust lib.rs
async fn make_post_request() -> Result<PostResponse, String> {
    let url = "https://api.example.com/endpoint"; // The URL of the endpoint to make the request to
    let post_data = ("key1", "value1"); // any serializable data can be passed in

    // Make POST request and parse JSON response
    let response: PostResponse = fetch_json(
        http_request_post_json(&url, &post_data)?
    ).await.map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    Ok(response)
}
```

Other functions are available in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/wavs-wasi-chain/latest/wavs_wasi_utils/all.html#functions).

### Logging

Components can use logging to debug and track the execution of the component.

**Logging in development**:

Use `println!()` to write to stdout/stderr. This is visible when running `wasi-exec` locally.

```rust lib.rs
println!("Debug message: {:?}", data);
```

**Logging in production**

For production, you can use a `host::log()` function which takes a `LogLevel` and writes its output via the tracing mechanism. Along with the string that the developer provides, it attaches additional context such as the `ServiceID`, `WorkflowID`, and component `Digest`.

```rust lib.rs
host::log(LogLevel::Info, "Production logging message");
```

### Blockchain interactions

The following dependencies are required in `Cargo.toml` for Ethereum interactions:

```toml
[dependencies]
wavs-wasi-chain = { workspace = true }  # Blockchain interactions
alloy-sol-types = { workspace = true }  # ABI handling
alloy-sol-macro = { workspace = true }  # For Solidity type generation
```

Chain configs are defined in the `wavs.toml` file:

```toml wavs.toml
[chains.evm.local]
chain_id = "31337"
ws_endpoint = "ws://localhost:8545"
http_endpoint = "http://localhost:8545"
```

WAVS provides host bindings to get the chain config for a given chain name in the `wavs.toml` file:

```rust lib.rs
// Get the chain config for an Ethereum chain
let chain_config = host::get_evm_chain_config(&chain_name)?;

// Get the chain config for a Cosmos chain
let chain_config = host::get_cosmos_chain_config(&chain_name)?;
```

The `wavs-wasi-chain` crate provides the [`new_evm_provider` function](https://docs.rs/wavs-wasi-chain/latest/wavs_wasi_utils/ethereum/fn.new_evm_provider.html) which creates a new Ethereum provider along with other basic helpers to create an alloy client for interacting with the blockchain that can be used in a component:

```rust lib.rs
let provider = new_evm_provider::<Ethereum>(
    chain_config
        .http_endpoint
        .context("http_endpoint is missing")?
)?;
```

Visit the [wavs-wasi-chain documentation](https://docs.rs/wavs-wasi-chain/latest/wavs_wasi_utils/all.html#functions) for more information on the functions available for interacting with the blockchain.

### Sol! macro

The `sol!` macro from `alloy-sol-macro` allows you to generate Rust types from Solidity interface files. This is useful for handling blockchain events and data structures in components.

In the template, the `sol!` macro is used in the `trigger.rs` component file to generate Rust types from the `ITypes.sol` file.

```rust trigger.rs
mod solidity {
    use alloy_sol_macro::sol;
    pub use ITypes::*;

    // The objects here will be generated automatically into Rust types.
    // If you update the .sol file, you must re-run `cargo build` to see the changes.
    sol!("../../src/interfaces/ITypes.sol");
}
```

The macro reads a Solidity interface file and generates corresponding Rust types and encoding/decoding functions. In the example above, it reads `ITypes.sol` which defines:
- `NewTrigger` event
- `TriggerInfo` struct
- `DataWithId` struct

Documentation for the `sol!` macro can be found at: https://docs.rs/alloy-sol-macro/latest/alloy_sol_macro/macro.sol.html

### Environment and Configuration Variables

Components can be configured with two types of variables:

#### KV: public variables

These variables can be used for non-sensitive information that can be viewed publicly. These variables can be configured in the makefile and are set during service deployment. They are accessed using `std::env::var` in the component.

To add public variables, modify the `"kv"` section in the `SERVICE_CONFIG` in your `Makefile`:

```makefile
SERVICE_CONFIG='{
  "fuel_limit": 100000000,
  "max_gas": 5000000,
  "host_envs": ["WAVS_ENV_MY_API_KEY"],
  "kv": [
    ["max_retries", "3"],
    ["timeout_seconds", "30"],
    ["api_endpoint", "https://api.example.com"]
  ],
  "workflow_id": "default",
  "component_id": "default"
}'
```

Then use these variables in your component:

```rust
let max_retries = std::env::var("max_retries")?;
let timeout = std::env::var("timeout_seconds")?;
let endpoint = std::env::var("api_endpoint")?;
```

#### Host environment variables

Private Environment Variables (`host_envs`) can be used for sensitive data like API keys. These variables are set by operators in their environment and are not viewable by anyone. These variables must be prefixed with `WAVS_ENV_`. Each operator must set these variables in their environment before deploying the service. Only variables listed in `host_envs` will be available to the component.

To add private variables, set the environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
WAVS_ENV_MY_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

Then modify `"host_envs"` in the `SERVICE_CONFIG` section of your `Makefile`:

   ```json
   "host_envs": ["MY_API_KEY"]
   ```

Configuration is set during service deployment:

```json
SERVICE_CONFIG='{
  "fuel_limit": 100000000,
  "max_gas": 5000000,
  "host_envs": ["WAVS_ENV_MY_API_KEY"],
  "kv": [["max_retries", "3"]],
  "workflow_id": "default",
  "component_id": "default"
}'
```

The following example shows how to access a private environment variable in a component:

```rust
let api_key = std::env::var("WAVS_ENV_MY_API_KEY")?;
```

### Submission

A service handler or submission contract handles the logic for submitting a component's output to the blockchain. A submission contract must implement the `handleSignedData()` function using the `IWavsServiceHandler` interface. This interface is defined in the `@wavs` package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wavs/solidity?activeTab=code

In the template, the [submission contract](https://github.com/Lay3rLabs/wavs-foundry-template/tree/v0.3.0/src/contracts/WavsSubmit.sol) uses the `handleSignedData()` function to validate the operator's signature and store the processed data from the component. The `DataWithId` struct must match the output format from the component. Each trigger has a unique ID that links the data to its source.

```solidity
function handleSignedData(bytes calldata _data, bytes calldata _signature) external {
    // 1. Validate the operator's signature by calling the `validate` function on the `_serviceManager` contract
    _serviceManager.validate(_data, _signature);

    // 2. Decode the data into a DataWithId struct defined in the `ITypes` interface
    DataWithId memory dataWithId = abi.decode(_data, (DataWithId));

    // 3. Store the result in state
    _signatures[dataWithId.triggerId] = _signature;      // 1. Store operator signature
    _datas[dataWithId.triggerId] = dataWithId.data;      // 2. Store the data
    _validTriggers[dataWithId.triggerId] = true;         // 3. Mark trigger as valid
}
```
